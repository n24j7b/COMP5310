COMP5310 Project Stage 1 
Explore, clean, summarise and analyse the data
Due: 11:59PM on 5th of September 2024 (Week 6) 
This assignment is worth 15% of the final mark of the unit of study. 
DATASETs 
For this assignment, each   member of   a   group   needs to   work   on   a   different   dataset.   We   have   provided three groups of datasets: Group A,   Group   B,   and   Group   C.
Group A: 
•          Laptop   Prices
•          Player   Scores
Group B: 
•         Credit   Score
•          Malware   Detection
Group C: 
•         Card   Fraud   Detection
•          Rental   PricesIf   your   group   has   2   members,   one   member   must   select   a   dataset   from   Group   A,   while   the   other member must select a dataset from Group B. Alternatively, if your group has 3   members,   one   member   must   select   a   dataset from   Group   A,   another   member   must   select   a   dataset from Group   B, and the   third   member   must select   a   dataset   from   Group   C.
In Stage 1, each member will work on a different dataset, and then by the end of Stage 1, your group needs to agree on a single dataset to use for Stage 2 of the project. 
GROUPS 
This   assignment   is   done   in groups of 2 or 3.   All   students   in   a   group   must   be   attending   the same lab session.
Note: there is work required from each member separately, but the project is handed in as a combined effort, and it is marked as a whole: there    will be individual and group components to the marks, all based on the single submitted document.
Group formation procedure In   Week   3   lab   session there will   bean   opportunity to   meet   other   students   and form   a group   with help from the tutor. Students must be in project groups with others who are all   timetabled   in the same   lab   session.Once you   have formed a group and chosen the datasets you will work   on   for   this   assignment,   you   need   to   submit   your UNIKEYS and   dataset   choices   by   completing   the   following   form. https://forms.office.com/r/GgcGsuDpvz. 
Important Notes: 
• You can only submit the form ONCE.   Ensure   your   Unikeys   and   datasetselections   are correct   before submission.
• You will NOT be allowed to change the chosen datasets after   submission,   so   choose   wisely.
In Week   3   lab:
•          Exchange names and contact information (e.g., which social media platforms you   prefer for coordinating).
•         Arrange   when   to   get   together:   at   least   one   meeting   per   week   (in   addition   to   your   scheduled   lab session)   is vital,   but   more frequent coordination   is even   better.
Dispute resolution If   during   the   course   of   the   assignment   work   there   is   a   dispute   among   group   members   that   you can’t resolve or that will impact your group’s capacity to complete the task well, you need   to   inform   the   unit   coordinatormaryam.khaniannajafabadi@sydney.edu.auor   one   of   the   TAs:
daniela.rivasromero@sydney.edu.au, ewon6930@uni.sydney.edu.au, or [email   protected]. Make   sure that   your   email   specifies   the   lab   session   and   group name   and    is   explicit   about   the   difficulty;   also   make   sure   this   email   is   copied   to   all   group   members   (including anyone you are complaining   about)   and your   lab   tutor.We need to know about problems in time to help fix them,   so   set   early   deadlines   for   group   members,   and   deal   with   non-performance   promptly   (don’t   wait   till   a   few   days   before   the   work   is   due   to   complain   that   someone   is not   delivering   on   their   tasks). If    necessary,   the   coordinator   will   split   a   group   and   leave   anyone who   didn’t   participate   effectively   in   a   group   by themselves   (they will   need to   achieve   all the   outcomes   on their   own). This option is only available up until Friday Week 5, which   is the   last   day   with time   to   resolve   the   issue   before   the   due   date.   For   any   group   issues   that   arise   after   this   time,   you   will   need   to   try   to   resolve   the   problem   on your own,   and you will continue   to   be   treated   as   a   single   group   which   all   get   the same   mark for this stage,   based on whatever   is   submitted   (though you   should   still   let   the   coordinator, TAs   and   lab tutor   know   about them).   If this   is the   case,   groups   may   be   changed   after Stage   1   is finished.
PROJECT 
Overview The   objective   of   Stage 1 of   the project is   to acquire   and meticulously   clean   the    dataset,   followed   by   a   comprehensive   analysis   to   derive   meaningful   insights.   Additionally,   you   will   define   a   research   question   based   on   a   research   or   business   requirement,   which   you   aim   to   answer   in Stage   2.
DELIVERABLES 
Report The   report   must   have   a   maximum of   3   pages for each   individual section   and   a   maximum   of   2   pages for the   group   section   for   a   group   of   2,   and   3   pages for   a   group   of   3. You   must   use   the   high-level   headings   provided   below to   indicate the different sections and   sub-sections   of the   report. You   must   use   line   spacing of   at   least   1.15pt,   margins of   at   least   1.8cm,   and   body font   size of at   least   10pt. The goal   is to convey   the   problem   clearly   and   concisely.
The   report   must   have   a   front   page that   gives:   the group number and activity code,   and   the list of members involved   (giving their SIDs AND unikeys, NOT their names).
The   body of the   report   must   have a structure   as follows:
Individual Component 
The report must begin with a   section per   group member (state the member’s unikey to   identify each   individual section).   Each   individual section   must   include:
1.       To代 写COMP5310 Project Stage 1 Explore, clean, summarise and analyse the dataPython
代做程序编程语言pic and research question: Provide   a   comprehensive   and   insightful   description   of the   problem,   highlighting   the   business/research   need,   clearly   state   your   research   question,   and indicate some groups of stakeholders and how they could be   helped   by answering the   research question.
2.       Data description: Provide   a   description   of   the   data,   indicating   the   number   of   attributes   and instances, and state the    relevant metadata about this dataset, including a data   dictionary which   indicates the attributes   on your dataset,   a   description   of   each   attribute,   and the data type of each   attribute   (int, float,   string,   date,   etc.).
Note: The data dictionary can be included as an appendix and will not be counted towards the page limit. 
3.       Data ingestion and cleaning: Describe the   data   ingestion   and   data   quality   assurance   and   cleaning   process,   including:
3.1. Data ingestion: Describe   any   data   ingestion   steps,   indicating   if   you   used   a   Pandas   data   frame   or   a   database   in   PostgreSQL,   and   briefly   describe   the   data   structure   or   schema.
3.2. Data quality assurance and cleaning: Describe how you ensured data quality, if there   were   any   quality   problems,   describe what they were   and   how you   cleaned the   data.   Remember to justify your decisions, for   example,   if you   decide   to   remove   any   rows   with   missing   data,   explain   why   you   decided   to   do   this   and   how   your   decision   might   impact   data   quality.   Indicate   which   tools   you   used   to   ingest   and   clean   the   data,   for   example,   indicate which   Python functions you   used to clean your data.
Note: You don’t have to include the code on the report, as you will submit it separately. 
4.       Exploratory    data    analysis    (EDA): Describe in detail any exploratory data analysis    you   performed   which   provided   you   relevant   information   to   answer   your   research   question.   This analysis must include TWO supporting figures and a detailed discussion of the results   obtained, indicating   what   they   tell   you    about   your   data and how   these results could   impact the   modelling   results   in   the   next   stage   of the   project. Do not include a matrix of figures of multiple analysis of all attributes,   you   need   to   select   and   highlight   the   TWO   most   important   results from your analysis. 
Group Component 
Finally, you will   need to   include   a group section   at the   end   of the   report,   including:
1.       Discussion: Discuss   your   thoughts   on   the   strengths   and    limitations   of   each   dataset,   for   the   purpose   of   investigating   the   question   of   interest.   Discuss   and   critically   analyse   the   exploratory data analysis performed in each individual sections, highlighting the strengths   and   limitations of each   approach.
2.       Conclusion: Summarise the   most   important outcomes from   the   exploratory   data   analysis   performed   by all members of the group, and include a   recommendation, with   reasons,   on   which dataset to   use for the   next stage   of the   project.Note: The different report sections    and sub-sections are aligned    with the marking rubric. Therefore, please includeonly the requested contents and do not mix or merge the sections, as this will interfere with the marking process. For example, don’t include the data cleaning steps under the exploratory data analysis section, this must be included in the data cleaning section. If you fail to do so, this won’t be considered for the marking. 
Code and Dataset You   must also submit the   Python code   used   in this assignment   as   a single zip or tar.gz folder.   This   compressed   folder   must   contain   one   subfolder   for   each   member   of   the   group,   named   using their   unikey. These subfolders   must   include the following:
1.       The Jupyter notebook with the code   each member used to perform. their work,   named   “unikey_A1_Code.ipynb”   .
2.       The final clean dataset   in   CSV format,   named “   unikey_A1_CleanDataset.csv”   .
